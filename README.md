# Chemical Equilibrium Solver

This repo is for solving for chemical equilibrium thermodynamics. It is currently under development to include Helmholtz and Gibbs energy minimization. 

## How to run.

Currently, there are four air compositions available and built into the code itself. These are accesible through the the use of the enum class `GasType::'.
