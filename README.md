# Chemical Equilibrium Solver

This repo is for solving for chemical equilibrium thermodynamics. It currently has everything necessary to compute mass/molar concentrations of air as well as thermodynamic properties at a given density and internal energy. 

## Main executable.

The main executable can be run with: ./gibbs <rho> <e> <mix_type>.

<rho> is the density, <e> is the internal energy, and <mix_type> is a string that says which mixture to use. Currently, there are 5 different air mixtures available:

- air5
