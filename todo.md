Since the structure of



## Helmholtz Energy

-- form_elemental(): This functio currently contains two if statements for the ion and temperature charges. Consider moving this into form_charge() and form_T() functions? Or keep it in if time change is negligible. 

-- form_charge(): Currentlye has one if statement for the temperature column. Same as above

-- form_temp() (usually form_UV(), form_HV())



## Gibbs Energy




## CESolver Library

This library should be able to solve Gibbs and Helmholtz energy. 

## Matrix Structure.
